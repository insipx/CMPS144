ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
Complete HiLoGame.java that allows a person to play agains the computer and guess the number selected by the computer. The message placed in the pop up menus displays the current range of values. It starts with 1 and 100, inclusive. After each guess, the Lo Hi range is properly adjusted to precisely indicate the exact range of possible numbers. There are several places where the code must be completed:

    Two places when the person makes a guess outside the range, let them now, and let them quess again.
    Let them know when they must guess LOWER, adjust the range and let them guess again.
    Let then know when they must guess HIGHER, adjust the range and let them guess again.
   In the if-else structure outside the game loop display one of two pop-up displays to indicate that they have succeeded or failed along with information about the number of guesses and the number that was sought
   Keep track of the number of guesses so that the loop will terminate once they have reached the number of guesses.
   Also, make sure that your message to the player precisely describes the correct range with words, and/or mathematical symbols.
